Title: Comprehensive Test Input for Data Processing Pipeline

1. Normal Text:
This is a sample input file for testing the data processing pipeline. It contains various types of text that will be cleaned and processed.

2. Hip-Hop Slang and Contractions:
Yo, homie! This pipeline is dope, ain't it? We're gonna flex our NLP skills and drop some sick beats on this text. It's gonna be lit!

3. Mathematical Expressions:
Let's include some math: E = mc^2 is Einstein's famous equation. The quadratic formula is x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a).

4. Special Characters and Emojis:
Check out these special chars: @#$%^&*()_+{}|:"<>?~`-=[]\\;',./
And some emojis: 😊🚀🎉👍💻

5. URLs and Email Addresses:

I'm a lyrical miracle, spiritual individual
Criminal subliminal in your swimming pool
My rhymes are skippin' and flippin' and dippin' and skippin'
The illest and realest, my skill is the sickest

14. Complex Mathematical Expression:
The Fourier transform F(ω) of f(t) is given by:
F(ω) = ∫[−∞ to ∞] f(t) * e^(−iωt) dt

15. Code Snippet:
def process_text(input_text):
    cleaned_text = clean(input_text)
    normalized_text = normalize(cleaned_text)
    return analyze(normalized_text)
